      <p align="left">According to the UNHCR, approximately 981 000 000 people are currently refugees, internally displaced or stateless. Though this is not directly connected to climate change, many migrants and refugees are forced out of their homes as a result of natural disasters. Often, these disasters are magnified by the effects of climate change on the earth.</p>

    <p align="left">Recent hurricanes in the Atlantic, like Harvey, Irma and Maria are terrifying examples of these climate change-magnified disasters. They slammed into Caribbean islands and southern America with extreme force, and a large part of their strength came from environmental factors affected by climate change.

For hurricanes to form, ocean water must be 26 degrees or above. Due to warming oceans, which are a result of global warming, these storms have formed and used the increased ocean temperature to increase in strength.

The warmer oceans mean that the storm’s winds are strong, even when they make landfall. This means that hurricane is stronger, causes more damage, and therefore displaces more people – Hurricane Irma’s winds were so strong when they made landfall that they set of seismometers, which are designed to measure earthquakes.

While Harvey caused people to be internally displaced within the U.S.A, both Irma and Maria have potentially caused the first wave of climate refugees to emerge from the Caribbean islands. Many small islands, like Barbuda, were slammed by these two unusually powerful hurricanes in quick succession– the country’s entire population of 1 400 has been evacuated to Antigua, and the Prime Minister said that the island was left “virtually uninhabitable” by Irma. Even in larger island nations, Irma caused mass evacuation and continued displacement– 1.7 million Cubans were evacuated from their homes, and widespread damage to many provinces has left at least 16 500 internally displaced.</p>

<div class"row"><img src="images/irma.jpg">

<br>
<p align="left">Though these people were not directly displaced by climate change, the effects of global warming has quite clearly affected migration patterns– environmental migration researcher Maria Cristina Garcia says that the world is “facing a new type of environmentally driven migration that will be more fast and furious.”

In an interview with Cornell University, Garcia also expressed concern about a lack of legal protection for refugees affected by climate change; they are not included in the legal definition of refugee. “The term… is defined very precisely in international law,” she said. “In U.S. law, for example, refugees are defined as individuals persecuted because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular group, or political opinion. Nowhere does climate figure into it. It leaves this entire group of people without international protection or recognition.”

Though no concrete statistics are available on climate refugees, as the oceans warm and disasters become more frequent, it seems likely that more people will be forced from their homes as a result of climate change. </p>

      <p>We are all aware of the rising temperature on Earth, but perhaps the most critical news is the increasing sea levels per year. Even the smallest temperature increase caused by climate change can have severe global effects.

Latest sea level is 84.8mm measured July 2017 – NASA Climate
Rate of Change is increasing by 3.4mm per year

The increase in global sea levels are due to the melting of land-based ice and the thermal expansion of water. According to the Ocean Service, the ‘oceans are absorbing more than 90% of the increased atmospheric heat associated with emissions from human activity’. This is significant as it contributes to the extreme weather conditions such as -  stronger and more frequent storms, increased rainfall, nuisance flooding, heat waves etc. This existing battle with climate change will continue to put countries, lives and habitats at risk.

    <p>These islands are slowly being engulfed by the rising sea levels. Out of the five islands under alarming danger, four are surrounding Australia. Let’s have a look at the population of each of these islands to work out, just how many people are going to be effected.
<br><blockquote>
<br>1.	Kiribati = 114,390
<br>2.	Tuvalu = 11,100
<br>3.	Fiji = 898,760
<br>4.	Solomon Islands = 599,420</blockquote>

‘On average, around 26.4 million people per year have been displaced from their homes by disasters brought on by natural hazards. This is the equivalent to one person being displaced every second’ -  Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre

What Now?
Rising sea levels are continually putting residents living by the coast of these islands at great risk, driving unwanted displacement within their own borders or worse, forced migration across international seas.

We may not be able to stop natural disasters completely or bring the sea level to a halt, but it is the action of today that will save economic and human costs for the future. It is up to us and the people in power to be proactive, which will be the difference between further suffering or effective relocation management.

Migration has been a part of human evolution since the beginning of time. Cultural groups and individuals have moved across borders and oceans to flee persecution, find food & shelter, for better opportunities and change, but now, migration due to climate change is on the rise.

Internationally, island nations and low-lying countries are facing the very-real threat of inundation and erosion, with many choosing to migrate before it’s too late. Barren countries such as Somalia are in the midst of generational drought and famine, and the harsh terrain continues to fuel this heartbreak.

But closer to home, the effects of climate change are also being felt. Crop farmers are moving off their land for a number of reasons, many of which can be linked back to climate change. The increase in average temperatures, lack of rainfall and extreme weather events have seen a gradual change in conditions and the land being farmed.

Across Australia these conditions are being experienced in different ways. Adaptation and mitigation are now major focuses in farming practice and traditional methods are being developed to fit with the changing times. In the farming community of the Wimmera-Mallee region of Victoria (about a five hour drive from Melbourne) farms are dealing with climate related effects on a daily basis, many of which tend to go unnoticed.

The Birchip Cropping Group in Birchip, Victoria, considers these effects through science-based research, predominantly in the area of broad-acre cropping. Company CEO Chris Souness believes that when talking about climate change, one of the biggest considerations should be the language in which it is reported on.

“Climate change by its very definition is an incremental or gradual thing… The only way you can notice it is in looking at the data and looking at how the average mean nightly temperature is now warmer - the trend is on a far warmer basis than it was in the past. The average mean/minimum temperature is actually higher… And I think that’s one of the challenges that in the past climate change has often alienated the farming community in particular.”</p>


“I think it’s very important to pitch the discussion right - and the only way to kind of do that is by looking at the data otherwise there is a lot of climate variability… When you start looking at how these extremes are more frequent, that’s when you start getting on solid ground as you’re on a long-enough cycle to present a compelling argument and I think we now have a compelling argument to show that nighttime temperatures are getting warmer.”

“Farmers tend to point out events in the past that are similar or in their minds are similar and they go “they’ve happened in the past, they’re happening now”. But when you look at the actual evidence there is clear evidence to show that the temperatures are in general warmer than they have been in the past and having more extreme events seems more likely.”

<p>
So where does that leave our farmers?

Increasingly, famers in the cropping industry are experiencing a number of incremental changes and are using research and development (with the help of companies like BCG) to better their farming practices - such as trialing new herbicides and investing in new equipment. They are also implementing transformational changes - things such as having an off-farm income, leasing land and selling the farm are often considered.

“A lot of the practices climate change would indicate a farmer should be undertaking, they should be undertaking even if there wasn’t climate change… The clearest way I would say they’re responding to climate change is farmers may have bought land in another climatic zone. So they farmed in one area and bought a farm somewhere else.

They’re all options a farmer has always had, but climate change brings that home to roost.”

“I like to joke with some farmers and say ‘they know they’ve been successful when they’ve shut down their local footy club’ - because they’ve bought out all the other farms.”

But while this is the case for some, for others they’re the ones being brought out.

“If you drive through country anywhere, all the towns seem to be standing still or getting smaller and there’s a few sponge towns that get bigger… And that’s the nature as the farms become depopulated because of this issue of scale and management.

And while many considerations make up a decision to move off the land, many can also be linked back to climate change. Interestingly though, most of the time the decision to leave isn't because farmers or families have no options left, it’s because of the changing nature of the farming and agriculture industry as a whole.

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><h4>“So what is changing in agriculture is the change in skills. So when you say farmers, what I think you mean is someone who is out there wearing a checked shirt in the paddock and working hard - what’s changing now is farmers and farming… like most industries, it’s changing towards a high-tech industry where people need multiple skills and a range of technical experts. And where those experts choose to live - some choose to live in the community and others can be a lot further away from the community - that is the changing nature of farming that farmers can manage more resources or more land area but they buy in a lot more of expert support…

This whole shape of what a farmer is is rapidly changing…

So they have an agronomist, an accountant, a farm business manager, they’ll have groups like BCG which do their research and development for them, they might, more and more, have the need for precision agriculture and digital agriculture… GIS specialists… communications specialists -social media in agriculture, twitter in agriculture is one of the main tools farmers use.”</h4></div></div>

Nowadays, the ‘farmer’ isn't necessarily out on the farm all day. Commuting from bigger rural communities is becoming more common with families deciding to live closer to schools, off-farm jobs and central communities. Younger generations are moving away to further tertiary studies (as education has become equally as valued in farming communities) with the hope of returning to the farm at the end of their degree with a broader and more modern skill set. The need for new technologies and practices in agriculture has opened a new avenue of work that young people can see value in pursuing and bringing back to the farm in later years.

“So the farmer who traditionally lived on the farm is now commuting out to the workplace as a place of work [and that might be an hour away] … because living on a farm in a changing climate or where climate change is not necessarily acknowledge but is impacting, because the farm is a tough environment in the summer months, and is less attractive for a family to be… You can’t put it down to any particular thing but a town that has a medical facility, doctors, sporting facilities… is a more attractive place to live on the surface [for a child to grow up in] than a farm might be - isolated.”

But how do we then ensure that our farms remain prosperous and resistant to harsh and changing climates?

“In the next 5-10 years, I still think that the major impact that people see, or the major driver will be through droughts, frosts, floods and fire. None of those can be particularly attributed to climate change but each of them are affected by having a warmer, dryer climate - so they’re all amplified.

Climate change is a policy discussion and policy decisions need to have climate change front-and-centre… You want people to think, so emphasising  around seasonal climate risk and variability and how to respond to the extremes is a far more successful - or going to be a more successful root  - to engage the farmers in rural communities on how to respond to the changing climate rather than put it down to climate change.”
